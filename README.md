# Mamba Biometric EKG Analysis Technology (MambaBEAT)

## Introduction
The field of Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) analysis has seen significant advancements with the advent of deep learning models. State-of-the-art models such as ResNet, Transformer, ViT, and H3 have demonstrated remarkable performance in EKG classification tasks. However, the quest for more efficient and accurate models is a continuous journey. This proposal introduces a novel project, provisionally named Mamba Biometric EKG Analysis Technology (MambaBEAT), which aims to leverage the Mamba model, a recent and promising sequence modeling architecture, for EKG analysis.
